version: 0.8.1

- Cxbx's compatibility has vastly increased (see compatibility list).

- Added video option to enable/disable hardware YUV surfaces for video playback.

- Fixed bug in vertex patching code for Vista (thanks defiance)!

- Most XDKs have at least basic support.

- Fixed pipeline bumpmapping is now supported.

- Multiple thread notification routines now supported.

- Lots of bug fixes.
