Changes - 14th October 2010
---------------------------

4.1c (Beta 3)
Tms99rf.cpp: Added functions for feeding text files to keyboard routines.
Tms99rf.cpp: Reading binary files from menu first checks where the data has to go into memory
	and using SamsWriteByte() function if in memory expansion area. Use CPU window for
	setting PC. (Need a S(tart) command for debug window?)
dsrfuncl3.cpp: Solved problem with offset in file when reading random files, record number is
	calculated as PAB[CPRECN]*256+PAB[CPRECN+1] and not as PAB[CPRECN*256]+PAB[CPRECN+1].
tms9900.cpp: LoadModule():
	Display program name and loaded module in caption of main window.
	Clear GROM space 3 through 15 when loading module to prevent incomplete
	module names in module menu.
ide.cpp: IdeRead():
	Emulator flag, DEC Century and BCD year is at addres >4D02, 4D04 and >4D06
	instead of >4E02, >4E04 and >4E06. Now emulator can timestamp files again
	on IDE image.
